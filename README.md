# deep-learning-challenge-Mod-21

Overview of the Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to predict the success of charity donations based on various features provided in the dataset. By training a neural network on historical data, we aim to create a predictive model that can classify whether a charity donation will be successful or not.

Results:

Data Preprocessing:

Target Variable(s): The target variable for our model is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column, which indicates whether a charity donation was successful (1) or not (0).
Feature Variable(s): The feature variables for our model include all columns in the dataset except for the target variable ("IS_SUCCESSFUL").
Variable(s) to be Removed: The variables "EIN" and "NAME" should be removed from the input data as they are neither targets nor features.
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:

Neurons, Layers, and Activation Functions: We selected two hidden layers for our neural network with 80 neurons in the first layer and 30 neurons in the second layer. ReLU activation functions were used for both hidden layers. Additionally, we used a sigmoid activation function in the output layer as it is suitable for binary classification tasks.
Target Model Performance: While the target model performance may vary depending on the specific requirements, we aimed to achieve an accuracy rate of at least 75%.
Steps Taken to Increase Model Performance: To improve model performance, we experimented with different hyperparameters, such as adjusting the number of neurons, layers, and activation functions. Additionally, we performed feature engineering, data normalization, and regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and enhance generalization.
Summary:

Overall, the deep learning model achieved promising results with an accuracy rate close to the target performance. However, further optimization may be required to achieve higher accuracy or address specific requirements.

A different model that could potentially solve this classification problem is a gradient boosting classifier, such as XGBoost or LightGBM. These models are known for their efficiency in handling tabular data and often perform well in classification tasks. Additionally, ensemble methods like Random Forest could also be explored, as they offer robustness and interpretability, which could be beneficial in understanding the factors contributing to charity donation success.
